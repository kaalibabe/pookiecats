### Project Description

Meet PookieCats, the browser extension that injects a daily dose of cat chaos into your online life.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Are you a cat meme lover like us? Do you listen and watch cat memes all day like us? Do you miss those pookies during your work? Do you wanna enjoy them while scrolling throught twitter or watching youtube? üòπ

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Its your lucky day! We created an extension for your favorite browser. Just plug in and voilah!!

Open your favorite youtube video and like them if you want. I mean, like them, if you can üòπ . Our Notorious and Annoying pookie wont let you to do so. Drag it away if you can. Or Try escaping from it while its sleeping. Any how, the cute pookie will just jump on your like button and unlike it. It just hates how you are watching brain rot videos everyday.

You might be like: So What? Lets scroll through twitter then?
Its ok. But if you are depressed our pookies will be too! It will start to cry based on the post your read and then flood your browser with the tears??

But if you are happy like reading happy posts, then so is our pookie. He will start jumping all over and celebrate with emoji rain all over!

What about anger?? It will hate you for seeing frustrating content. And explode the pages everywhere wont letting you read the content.
